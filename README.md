# Multi-Purpose Data Analysis Web Application

A comprehensive Streamlit-based web application that provides two distinct data analysis tools for statistical calculations and demographic analysis.

## Features

### üßÆ Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator
- Transforms 9 numbers into statistical analysis of a 3x3 matrix
- Calculates mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum
- Provides analysis along different axes (columns, rows, flattened)
- Interactive input with quick example buttons
- Visual matrix representation with pandas DataFrame

### üìä Demographic Data Analyzer  
- Analyzes census demographic data using pandas
- Supports CSV file upload or sample data generation
- Comprehensive analysis including:
  - Race distribution and demographics
  - Education level impact on income
  - Work patterns and hour analysis
  - Geographic earning patterns
  - Occupation analysis by region
