Multi-Purpose Data Analysis Web Application
A comprehensive Streamlit-based web application that provides two distinct data analysis tools for statistical calculations and demographic analysis.

Features
üßÆ Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator
Transforms 9 numbers into statistical analysis of a 3x3 matrix
Calculates mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum
Provides analysis along different axes (columns, rows, flattened)
Interactive input with quick example buttons
Visual matrix representation with pandas DataFrame
üìä Demographic Data Analyzer
Analyzes census demographic data using pandas
Supports CSV file upload or sample data generation
Comprehensive analysis including:
Race distribution and demographics
Education level impact on income
Work patterns and hour analysis
Geographic earning patterns
Occupation analysis by region
